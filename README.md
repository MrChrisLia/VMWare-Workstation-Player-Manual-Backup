# VMWare-Workstation-Player-Manual-Backup\

Since VMWare Workstation Player doesn't include free snapshots, this is a small script to backup the VM manually.

This has not been tested in Windows VMs

It requires the root user to have a password. So before backing up and opening the snapshot, make sure the root user has a password!

Make sure to close all VMware VMs and processes before attempting the backup.

The backup may fail, so make sure to test your backup before forgetting!
